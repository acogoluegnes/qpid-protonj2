# Apache Qpid protonj2

Qpid protonj2 is a high-performance, lightweight AMQP protocol library. It can be used in the widest range of messaging applications, including brokers, client libraries, routers, bridges, proxies, and more. This project provides an AMQP [protocol engine](protonj2/README.md) for building your own AMQP client and servers as well as a full featured imperative API [client](protonj2-client/README.md). If you want to test your AMQP implementation the project also provides an AMQP [test framework](protonj2-test-driver/README.md) useful for writing scripted tests of both clients and servers.
